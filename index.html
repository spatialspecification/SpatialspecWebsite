                            <strong>Feature:</strong> Comprehensive capture of all site features including buildings, fences, trees, retaining walls, and underground services. Our feature surveys provide accurate spatial data essential for architectural design, engineering planning, and property development. We locate and map all visible improvements and infrastructure to create a complete picture of existing conditions.

                            <strong>Contour:</strong> Precise ground level surveys and contour mapping for design development and drainage analysis. Contour surveys establish the natural topography of a site, enabling engineers and architects to design with the land. Essential for stormwater management, cut and fill calculations, and ensuring compliant building platforms.
