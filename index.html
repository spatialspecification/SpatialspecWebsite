                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Feature:</strong> Comprehensive site documentation capturing buildings, structures, utilities, vegetation, and all physical elements of your property. We use total stations and GNSS technology to deliver accurate coordinates and heights for every feature. Ideal for architects, engineers, and planners who need reliable base data before commencing design work.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Contour:</strong> Detailed ground surface modelling that reveals how water flows across your site and where levels change. We capture spot heights at strategic intervals and generate contour lines at your required spacing. Essential for drainage design, cut-and-fill calculations, and understanding site constraints before construction begins.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Volume:</strong> Precise measurement of stockpiles, excavations, and material quantities using survey-grade equipment. We provide before-and-after comparisons, progress volumes, and certified quantity reports. Perfect for quarries, construction sites, and any project requiring accurate material tracking for payment or inventory purposes.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Topographic:</strong> The complete picture—combining features, contours, and site boundaries into one comprehensive survey deliverable. We capture everything visible on site and present it in CAD-ready formats compatible with all major design software. The foundation document that architects, engineers, and planners rely on throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Elevation:</strong> Precise floor level and building height surveys for construction compliance and certification. We verify that slabs, floors, and structures meet design specifications and council requirements. Delivered with formal reports suitable for building surveyors, certifiers, and regulatory submissions.</p>

                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Setout:</strong> Transferring design coordinates from drawings to the physical site with millimetre precision. We mark positions for footings, columns, walls, services, and any element requiring accurate placement. Using robotic total stations and GNSS, we ensure your construction team builds exactly where the design intended—avoiding costly rework and delays.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>As-built:</strong> Documenting what was actually constructed versus what was designed. We survey completed structures, underground services, and finished works to create permanent records. Deliverables include certified plans, 3D models, and reports suitable for handover documentation, asset management systems, and future reference.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Drone:</strong> Aerial surveying and photogrammetry capturing large areas quickly and safely. We deliver orthomosaic imagery, digital terrain models, and volumetric data from above. Ideal for progress documentation, stockpile measurement, site planning, and capturing areas difficult to access on foot.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Scan:</strong> High-definition 3D laser scanning that captures millions of points per second, creating precise digital replicas of existing conditions. We scan buildings, industrial facilities, heritage structures, and complex environments. The resulting point clouds integrate directly into BIM software for renovation planning, clash detection, and detailed analysis.</p>
                        <p class="service-description"><strong>Monitor:</strong> Scheduled surveys tracking movement, settlement, and deformation over time. We establish baseline measurements and return at agreed intervals to detect any changes. Early warning data helps protect structures, verify construction impacts on neighbours, and satisfy regulatory monitoring requirements.</p>
